# Marketing Costs
#
# Implement the 'desired_marketing_expenditure' function, which returns the required amount of money
# that needs to be invested in a new marketing campaign to sell the desired number of units.
#
# Use the data from previous marketing campaigns to evaluate how the number of units sold grows
# linearly as the amount of money invested increases.
#
# For example, for the desired number of 60,000 units sold and previous campaign
# data from the table below, the function should return the float 250,000.
