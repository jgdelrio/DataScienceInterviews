# Marketing Costs
#
# 1) Use the data from previous marketing campaigns to evaluate how the number of units sold grows
# linearly as the amount of money invested increases and build a model that captures that knowledge.
#
# 2) Implement a function 'desired_marketing_expenditure', which returns the required amount of money
# that needs to be invested in a new marketing campaign to sell the desired number of units.
# We recommend reusing the previous model. For the desired number of 60,000 units sold
# the expenditure in marketing should be 250,000.


# Data
data_marketing_campaign_expenditure = [300000, 200000, 400000, 300000, 100000]
data_marketing_campaign_units_sold = [60000, 50000, 90000, 80000, 30000]
